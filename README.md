# StaticCloud

StaticCloud is a minimalistic static file server built with FastAPI.
It serves files from a specified directory and provides an API endpoint to upload files using a token which is specified
by an environment variable.

It is designed to be used as the logo server for my Discord Bot [Emolga](https://github.com/TecToast/Emolga).

It was developed because the Google Sheets API doesn't allow image uploads to specific cells, but I needed a way to automatically show images in a Google Sheet.
